This is a fork of TVM for adding BYOC integrations for the 3LA project.


Right now we have a VTA integration in `src/relay/backend/contrib/vta_matmul`. Note that you have to include the line `SET(USE_VTA_MATMUL ON)` in `build/config.cmake` before building TVM to support this (other flags that should be on: `USE_LLVM`, `USE_VTA_FSIM`). We have a test of this backend in `tests/python/relay/test_external_codegen.py` (see `test_extern_vta()`).

This version also uses a fork of the VTA repo meant to dump logs.
Try `vta/python/integration/matmul_tutorial.py` to use the dumping facility.
VTA can be set into dumping mode by calling `vta.testing.simulator.dump_mode(True)`.
You can specify the location at which the dump will be deposited using `vta.testing.simulator.dump_target(path)`; the default is `./vta_sim_dump.json`.
See the readme at [the VTA fork](https://github.com/uwsampl/3la-vta) to see a description of the dumping mode and the dumping format.

You can use `vta.testing.ila_converter.convert(dump_file, dest_file)` to convert a VTA simulator dump into an ILA program fragment.

Apache TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
